    title: 'Credit Terms and Conditions'
    text: >-
      When executing a Tally Agreement, the Parties each decide the limits of Pledges of Value they will accept from the other Party.
      The Parties may also specify other terms and conditions that influence how and when the obligation will be satisfied.
      Those various parameters are together referred to as Credit Terms.
      Terms can be specified by the Vendor that will be applied to credit issued by the Client.
      Terms can also be specified by the Client that will be applied to credit issued by the Vendor, in such cases where the Tally develops a negative balance.
      These Terms are incorporated into the Tally Data and become part of the Agreement that is digitally signed by the Parties.
      In such cases where a particular Credit Term is not explicitly included in the Tally Data, the default value for that term, as listed below, shall apply.
      These various credit terms are defined in the Tally Data object by the property name shown in parentheses and are interpreted as follows:
    sections:
      -
        title: 'Maximum Balance (limit); Default: 24'
        text: >-
          This indicates the largest amount, in CHIPs, the Issuer can rely on becoming indebted to Recipient.
          There is nothing in this limit that prevents Issuer from making pledges in excess of this amount but Recipient is not obligated to accept such excess as payment for Product.
          The balance can be expressed as a single number.
          Or it may be given as an algebraic expression that is a function of Time (in days D or months M) such as in this example:
          "124000 - (124000 * M / 36)", which reduces a starting value down to zero over three years.
      -
        title: 'Call Notice (call); Default: unspecified'
        text: >-
          The number of days notice required to be given by Recipient to Issuer before the balance of principal and/or accrued interest can be called due and payable.
          If not specified, the Issuer has no obligation to reduce principal any faster than is indicated by the Minimum Payment.
          Call terms can be changed at any time by either party, but never in such a way as to limit Issuer's rights under the Tally.
          For example, when reducing the call from 120 to 30, the effective terms will still be 120 until that period of time has first elapsed, after which the new call period will become effective.
      -
        title: 'Security (lien); Default: None'
        text: >-
          This specifies any assets that are offered by the Issuer as collateral against amounts owed under the Agreement.
          It can contain one or more references to assets understood by the Parties including, but not limited to, recorded trust deeds, UCC liens, titles, serial numbers or model numbers.
          Leaving this property unspecified implies a personal (or corporate where applicable) guaranty of the amount owing with full recourse against any assets of the Issuer.
      -
        title: 'Maximum Paydown (mort); Default: No Maximum'
        text: >-
          This specifies the most the Issuer can pay down principal in advance of otherwise prevailing requirements and have his interest calculations reduced accordingly.
          This can be used to create a minimum interest return for a Recipient, while still allowing the Issuer to store value in the loan balance.
          This may also be given as an algebraic expression that is a function of Time (in days D or months M).
      -
        title: 'Compound Interval (period); Default: Monthly'
        text: >-
          The interval of time that passes before interest may be calculated and applied to the outstanding balance.
          Such calculations are expected to be performed by the Recipient and provided to the Issuer where applicable.
          For amortized balances, this also defines the regular payment interval.
      -
        title: 'Grace Period (grace); Default: 30'
        text: >-
          New amounts of indebtedness will not accrue interest charges until this many days have passed.
      -
        title: 'Rate (rate); Default: 0.05'
        text: >-
          An annualized rate of interest expressed as a positive floating point number.
          For example, 0.05 means 5% per annum.
          This number will be scaled to match the Compound Interval in order to compute the interest/dividend charges to be applied during an interval.
      -
        title: 'Minimum Payment (pay); Default: no limit'
        text: >-
          The smallest amount, in CHIPs, the Issuer may pay down the balance at each Compound Interval period.
          This may also be given as an algebraic expression that is a function of Time (in days D or months M).
