    title: 'Tally Testing and Evaluation Agreement'
    text: >-
      When invoked by a Tally, this Contract causes the resulting Agreement to be completely non-binding on the Parties regardless of the language that will follow.
      A Tally created with this Contract is solely for the purposes of testing and evaluation and no amounts mentioned are actually due or payable by either Party to the other.
      When using this tally, the Parties are solely and individually responsible for disabling lifts on the tally by configuring the appropriate Trading Variables (i.e. reward=1, clutch=1).
      Failure to do so on a production system where other binding tallies are in use will likely result in a total loss value from the resulting lift(s)!
