Building Hashes:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When changes are made to contract documents, it will be necessary to
regenerate the hash for that document.  This can be done with the hashes script
as follows:

  ./hash Free.yaml			#or
  ./hash *.yaml

You then must check to see if the references to other documents are correct by
running:

  ./refcheck *.yaml

Run these two commands alternately until all hashes and references are
resolved (no more messages).

Then, you may need to re-import the documents into the database by running
(in the schema directory):

  make init
