A CHIP is, at its heart, a credit agreement between two parties.  In other 
words, it is a contract--payable by one party and receivable by the other.

So the job of MyCHIPs is to organize and document these contracts.  And it
will do so just you might imagine with any legally binding agreement.
That way, if both parties share a legal jurisdiction, their agreements can
be enforced by that jurisdiction, in addition to natural community
penalties that would be incurred by defaulting on a contract.

This directory contains a few boilerplate examples of contract fragments.
Ideally, a contract would be comprised of multiple fragments.  The idea
is, you can mix and match various clauses together to build up a complete
contract agreement.  Ideally, there would be a relatively small universe
of "standard" contracts people recognize and get comfortable with.

Contract clauses will be incorporated into the parent contract by just
referring to the clause key (title, author, version and hash.)  So the 
clause itself doesn't get included into the parent contract--only the 
reference does.

Likewise, when incorporating a contract into a context such as a tally
or a lift, it is only necessary to refer to the contract key.  The key
would be incorporated into the string of data that gets signed, so that
constitutes a digital signature indicating the consent and agreement of
the parties.
