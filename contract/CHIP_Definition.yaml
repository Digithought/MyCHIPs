    title: 'Defining a CHIP'
    text: >-
      MyCHIPs is a standardized protocol to facilitate the documentation and exchange of Pledges of Value between willing parties.
      This Value, or credit, is comprised of a number of individual promises, or Chits, made by one Party, for the benefit of the other Party, to deliver future value according to terms and conditions mutually agreed upon hereby.
      The party Pledging the future value is referred to as the Issuer.
      The party the Pledge is made to is referred to as the Recipient.
      A Pledge accrues as a receivable asset to the Recipient and a payable liability to the Issuer just as with any open-account indebtedness that might be incurred in the ordinary course of business or commerce.

        title: 'Subdivision'
        text: >-
          The amount of value represented in a Tally or a Chit is quantified in units of CHIPs.
          Internally, a MyCHIPs server is expected to record transactions in integer units of 1/1000th of a CHIP.
          User interfaces are expected to render values as decimal CHIPs with up to 3 digits after the decimal point, for example: 1234.567.

        title: 'Exclusive Use of the CHIP'
        text: >-
          All transactions associated with this Tally shall be quantified exclusively in CHIPs, as defined herein, and not in any other unit of measure.
          For example, it is a breach of this covenant to produce a Pledge of Value which the Parties understand to be measured in Dollars or Euros.
          It is not necessarily a breach to buy or sell Dollars, or any other currency, using this Tally and/or at a price denominated in CHIPs.
          Nor is it necessarily a breach to satisfy a Pledge of Value by payment in Dollars, or any other currency, where acceptable to the Parties.

        title: 'CHIP Estimates not Binding'
        text: >-
          Various methods may exist for estimating the value of a CHIP in terms of existing currencies.
          For example, see https://chipcentral.net.
          Such estimates may even be displayed via a software interface such as a mobile application.
          But no estimate of the CHIP value shall be construed to bind a party to future payment by, or exchange into, in a particular currency at a particular rate.
          Rather, Pledges of Value are to be interpreted solely according to the CHIP Definition below.
