        title: 'Dispute Resolution'

        title: 'Frivolous Claims'
        text: >-

        title: 'Fraud'
        text: >-

        title: 'Honor'
        text: >-
          The debtor agrees to not excuse itself from honoring the agreement by reason of bankruptcy or similar recourse, even though prevailing law may allow it.
      -
        title: 'Indemnity'
        text: >-
          The Parties shall hold harmless MyCHIPs.org, its owners and affiliates, and all authors of and contributers to the MyCHIPs software and protocol for any loss related to its use.
      -
        title: 'Chain of Honor'
        text: >-
          The obligations related to good faith and honesty made by the Parties also extend to other parties they may be indirectly connected to.
          For example, it is a breach of this covenant to use your trading relationship under this Tally to defraud another party somewhere else on the MyCHIPs network.
          Each Party agrees to cooperate with the other in the rectification of any fraud or loss that may occur in the course of trading on this Tally.
          This cooperation implies the assignment of contract rights, as applicable, so that any unduly harmed party may invoke the rights of each party along a chain of transactions in order to remedy a fraud or undue loss.
