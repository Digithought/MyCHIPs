## Peer to Peer Connections

### Tally Request
Typically any first-time connection between two sites will be a request for a new tally.
A notable exception to this is if a site is also acting as a 
[Referee](/doc/Protocol.md#referee-queries) in which case it will be
expected to accept lift timeout queries from essentially anyone.

Connections associated with tally requests are conducted as follows:

- User A3 will request from his database a [tally ticket](/doc/Tallies.md#establishing-a-tally) granting access to his account.
  This also authorizes a peer site to establish a connection, absent key information.
  The ticket will be disclosed to User B1, via a reliable out-of-band pathway.
  For example, User B1 may scan a QR code on User A3's mobile device or User A3 may email or text the code to User B1.

- The ticket contains:
  - User A3's [CHIP address](learn-users.md#chip-addresses), indicating where to connect to do business with user A3;
  - An expiring, one-time token, authorizing connection without any other key information
    - The token will internally specify that it is for establishing a new tally
    - The token may optionally be limited to the specific CHAD of User B1
  - The token expiration date;
  - The public key of the issuing (A) site;

- Once in possession of the connection ticket,
  Site B connects (on behalf of B1) to site A.
  It sends a structure encrypted with the site A's public key, containing
    - The connection token;
    - The public key of site B;
    - An object (certificate) containing contact information about User B1 including its;
      - CHIP Address
      - Public Key
      - Name, address, email, other identifying data

  If site A can decrypt this message, and the token is still valid, it will:
    - Finalize opening of the connection;
    - Consider the connection as the initial steps in the
      [Tally Initiation Sub-protocol](/doc/Protocol.md#tally-protocol);
    - Continue with key exchange and tally negotiation;

  If the initiation message fails, site A should silently close the connection
  and may opt to initiate defensive measures (such as firewall blocking) against
  possible [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack).

### Subsequent Connection
  It is not generally allowable to accept a connection from a site unless the
  connection is related to a specific user on that site.
  For example, Site B may not connect to site A generically, nor may it connect to
  engage in a protocol on behalf of user A2.
  Rather Site B's business with Site A is limited to protocol messages related
  specifically to tallies (such as A3-B1) the two sites share in common.
  
  Furthermore, the tally should be properly signed by each of the parties and
  must include the public key of each user's site, indicating that the user
  authorizes the site to perform the lift protocol on behalf of the user.
  
  Having met these criteria, any site may connect to any other site at any time.
  The connection should be allowed and the message read, which is expected to
  belong to the standard set of [protocol messages](/doc/Protocol.md) and to
  pertain to a valid tally between users on the sites.
  
  Once a connection is open, it may be used for any tally shared by the two sites.
  So while an initial connecton is associated with a specific tally relationship,
  subsequent messages on the same channel may apply to other valid tallies
  between the sites.
  
  Messages may be sent by either side of the open connection at any time and for
  any valid reason and should be handled asynchronously and without regard to
  message order by each side of the connection.
  
  It expected that connections will be allowed to remain open for a time in
  expectation of other potential messages that may be forthcoming.
  
  Connections that have been open with no traffic for more than a specified 
  timeout may be closed.  It will be the responsibility of the responding
  peer (as opposed to the initiator) to decide if/when to close an idle
  socket connection.
    
### Noise Protocol Implementation
The [MyCHIPs Protocol](/doc/Protocol.md) describes a set of high level messages that
get passed back and forth between nodes in order to negotiate tallies, chits and lifts.

At a lower level, it is necessary for sites to connect to each other over a secure, encrypted channel.
MyCHIPs will use [Noise Protocol Framework](www.noiseprotocol.org)(NPF) to provide this security.
Two nodes may interconnect according to the following use pattern:

![use-noise](uml/use-noise.svg)

These patterns generate the following sequence of signals to establish an open communication channel over Noise Protocol:

![seq-noise](uml/seq-noise.svg)

For a first-time connection, NPF works great.
We can use the IK handshake pattern in which the initiator uses a ticket to authenticate and provide its own public key for the first time.

But for subsequent connections, there is a chicken-and-egg problem.
We want to use the KK pattern since both sides are already in possession of each other's static keys.
But we don't really know at first who is connecting on a given socket.

The connecting peer could provide this information in the first packet payload.
But NPF needs to be initialized in advance with both the pattern <b>and</b> each side's static keys.

This necessitates an initial one-way NPF packet being sent before any other in which the initiator declares its site identity.
This will use the N pattern which will keep the packet reasonably private and will provide sufficient information to the responder to invoke the appropriate key for subsequent packets.
If this initial packet is forged or modified, subsequent packets will not succeed because the shared key will not match.

To track this, packets will be prefixed with a single byte header as follows:
- I: Initial connection request from initiator to responder containing a connection ticket.
- N: One way transmission from initiator to responder, declaring initiator's site id (```address@port```).
- K: Subsequent connection request (sent immediately after N packet) .
- A: Noise acknowledge packet from responder to initiator, completes noise handshake.
- T: Regular transmission packet over established, encrypted channel.

Each connection should then in one of the following states:

![state-noise](uml/state-noise.svg)

The pending state is represented by a peer who initiates contact with a currently disconnected server.
The ticket and request states represent a server responding to a client connection request.

As a result, it is possible that two peers might initiate a connection to each other at about the same time.
This could result in two channels getting opened up between the two hosts.
While this is not optimal, it should not pose a problem as long as the communication module does not make any assumptions that it cannot happen.

### Key Security
Noise Protocol is based on the [Diffie Hellman protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffie%E2%80%93Hellman_key_exchange).
The implementation of Noise Protocol used by MyCHIPs is based on [libsodium](https://doc.libsodium.org/)
which utilizes the [Curve25219](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve25519) elliptical curve.

We will not be using the
[Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API)
in this instance as it appears to be limited to NIST approved curves which
[seem](https://safecurves.cr.yp.to/) to be less secure than Curve25519.

We will rely on the [security level of Curve52219](https://gist.github.com/atoponce/07d8d4c833873be2f68c34f9afc5a78a)
and the 256 bit keys provided for by libsodium.
This provides for a fairly short public key which will be welcome in producing managable URI's.
If/when libsodium may determine that current computing speeds justify a longer key, that change should propagate into MyCHIPs.
