Normal Consumer Transaction:

 - The vendor displays a ticket, normally as a 2D bar graph, consisting of
   - A token string:
     - Is set in the vendor's server to expire after a finite time
     - Is known in the vendor's server to allow certain kinds of access
   - The vendor's MyCHIPs ID
   - The vendor's MyCHIP certificate (ChipCert), containing
     - Vendor's public key
     - Vendor's uniquely identifying information
       - Name
       - Address
       - Email
       - Town
       - Province
       - Country
       - Jurisdiction
       - Tax ID (at creditor's option)

 - The customer scans the ticket
 - The customer's user agent contacts his server, via the secure back door,
 - And connects to the vendor's server, using the token as authorization
 - The vendor's information is registered in the customer's database

 - The customer can request a tally:
   - The tally would be a zero stock
   - It would allow the customer to collect vendor CHIPs, if desired

 - The customer can request pathway information, to evaluate a possible lift
   - What common ID's to you know downstream pathways to?

 - The customer can initiate lift inquiries
   - Request <amount> CHIP lift to ID<z>, via ID<y>, ID<x>, ..., expiring in <t>
   - Request committed pledge pathway
