#MyCHIPs Documentation
Copyright MyCHIPs.org; See license in root of this package

This folder contains documentation about how the source code was developed and
how to use it.

The high-level design of the software was created by writing the
[MyCHIPs Papers](http://gotchoices.org/mychips) published on gotchoices.org 
starting around the beginning of 2018.  The information there is quite 
extensive, going into some detail about possible financial derivative products 
and services that could develop surrounding a functioning MyCHIPs network.

While that original vision is still useful, many implementation details have
become more clear in the process of developing actual source code.  So the
documents here are often more current and more specific to the way MyCHIPs has
actually been implemented.

The figures included as .odg files can be opened in LibreOffice or a compatible 
program and are referenced at times from the documentation files.

The file [chipglass.svg](doc/chipglass.svg) is an attempt at a logo for MyCHIPs 
that indicates its origin in the notion that 
[time is money](http://gotchoices.org/mychips/whychips.html).  
The file [chip.svg](doc/chip.svg) is a suggested
"chip sign" analogous to the "dollar sign" to indicate units of CHIPs. 
It can easily be hand written by making a "figure 8" with two vertical lines through.
Alternately, one can write a "backwards 3" (or curly "E") followed by a closely 
placed "3" (to approximate an hourglass) and then add the two vertical lines.

The intent of this is to make a standard international symbol for a more
objective measure of value based on the essence of human time, and independent 
of the economic forces (such as supply and demand) that tend to change the 
price of human work in various economies.  Admittedly, the MyCHIPs definition 
of value is still not entirely objective.  However, it is much more objective 
than the modern definition of a Dollar, a Euro, or any other fiat currency.

The [Notes](doc/Notes) folder contains scans of original hand sketches notes, and 
calculations which could be helpful in understanding the implementation of the
software (if they can be read).

The [Projects](doc/Proj) folder contains specifications for coding projects 
developers might want to consider working on.

If you are starting work on MyCHIPs, it is a good idea to understand most of what
is in this folder.  Here is a suggested reading list:

- [Getting Started](doc/Development)
- [General Principles](doc/General)
- [How Tallies Work](doc/Tallies)
- [How Lifts Work](doc/Lifts)
- [Known Issues](doc/Bugs)
- [Response to the DSR Study](doc/Safety)
