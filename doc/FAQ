Frequently Asked Questions
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Often of the time a developer reviews this (or any) project, they start out by 
wanting to change the way it has been implemented.  While I don't doubt there 
are many other good ways the project could have been done, I have made the best 
choices I could given all the requirements before me.

I don't think it would be constructive to back up or start over on significant
parts of the toolchain used.  Rather, I think the best pathway forward is to 
get this reference implementation working as well as possible given its current 
implementation methods.  If it works, there will be time and motivation for 
other "from-scratch" versions to come along that might be more efficient or
elegant.

Can you build this system on top of (Etherium, holochain, other blockchain...)?

Not really.  Maybe somehow, but why?  Blockchain is a centralized data topology.
Transactions are designed to go through a common, public store.  MyCHIPs is a 
distributed data model.  There is no double-spending problem, no proof of Work, 
Stake, etc. required.

The part of blockchain technology that _is_ applicable is the notion of chained
hashes.  MyCHIPs does make use of them but it is implemented inside the
database so there is not really much benefit in trying to smash this algorithm
on top of another framework.

Why use Javascript on the backend?

The asynchronous character of Javascript is key to the way the server runs.  A
single process can be started which is really several servers in one.  Or, many
processes can be launched with a more singular purpose to each one.  This could
be more challenging to achieve in a single-minded or threaded model.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why use Vuejs?

All the UI developed so far is for my benefit as a developer.  While the admin
console could be used in production, that is not necessary.  I fully expect
other UI's to be developed if/when the middle and back is proven effective.

Certainly the end-user UI will need to be a user-friendly mobile app.  Whether
that is done in Vuejs, NativeScript, or Native Apple/Android coding is yet to
be determined.  For now, the user UI is simply a data-centric way to see and
access the resources expected to be available to a user in the eventual
production UI.

What is all this Wy* stuff?

Wyatt-ERP is a group of libraries I developed some years ago which provide for
rapid development of database applications.  It was originally implemented in 
TCL/TK for use PostgreSQL.  I ported the parts that were most useful to develop
MyCHIPs.  This involves 4 npm libraries:

  Wylib: Front End UI library, now ported to Vuejs
  Wyseman: Schema manager and database portal
  Wyclif: Control layer interface
  Wyseman: ERP schema library

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why use Wyatt-ERP?

Because I wanted to use PostgreSQL and Wyseman is the easiest/best way I know 
to do SQL development in a stable and repeatable way.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why use PostgreSQL?

First requirement of the system was that it be ACID.  There are transactions
coming into the model from all different directions and commits need to be
atomic.

PostgreSQL is at least as good as any other alternative in this category, if
not the best.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why not use a NoSQL database?

SQL is very helpful in querying the types of data structures produced in the
MyCHIPs algorithms.  Without it, there would be a huge amount of coding work
to be done in other ways.  SQL makes that quick and easy.

Document databases seem to shine most when the structure of the data being 
stored is not really known before-hand.  In those cases, we make good use of
PostgreSQL's JSON data type.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Can I use MySQL (SQLlite, etc.)

No.  MyCHIPs does not just store data in the database.  It is a model with
build-in intelligence consisting of many stored procedures and views.  
Switching to another database would be nearly starting over from scratch.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Why is your code so tightly packed?

Sorry, that's how I code.  It is easier for me to understand the code structure
when I can see larger parts of the logic flow in one page.  Each line tends to
be more concentrated than in other code you may see.  I don't get paid by the
line.

I also code a lot wider than 80 columns.  Assuming you're not still using a
VT100 or a teletype, make your window wider.  It will work.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Will it run on Windows?

Sure.  In Docker!
