## Data Message Encoding
Feb 2022; Copyright MyCHIPs.org

### General
A MyCHIPs network potentially consists of many different processes running on many different machines.
A single site is modeled as shown here:

[![System Design](uml/scaling.svg)](uml/scaling.svg)

The different components of the system will communicate with each other by passing messages encoded as JSON packets.
The common cases, covered in previous sections, are:
- User application <-> User service / Database; ([more detail](use-mobile.md#user-api-objects))
- Database <-> Agent service
- Peer Agent service <-> Peer Agent service (peer-to-peer)

In general, the user application will interact with the system by doing one of the following:
- Sending an SQL command, encoded in a JSON record, to the database;
- Invoking a control layer action handler, which will likely further interact with the database.

The mobile application will generally not be able to interact with a peer agent module as this may be
an entirely separate process from the User service.

### Message Targets
Communications related to (or destined for) peer agent services are handled by one of four different subsystems as follows:
- tally
- chit
- route
- lift

Most messages in the following cases will have a property called "target" containing the
name of the applicable subsystem.  The primary exception is in communication from the
agent process to the database since the subsystem is already inherently known by the
database procedure being called.

### Status and States
The database is the authoritative repository of the system state.
Processes in the control layer (user and agent processes) and or in the mobile app or other view 
applications should consider their data transitory and should rely on the model as much as necessary.

Each object (such as a tally) in each subsystem should contain a status field.
The object's status (possibly combined with other key fields) will indicate the state of the object.
The state will be used to make key decisions about how/when to transition to a new state.
Hopefully this will allow erronious or late messages to simply be ignored.

A subsystem may receive asynchronous requests from either a local user or a remote peer agent.

A user request is generated by writing a non-null value into the object's DB request field.
This implies the need for action by the applicable agent process in order to actually
accomplish the state change.  The value in the request field
typically indicates the next value intended to be written into the object's status field.
The database will detect the request and generate a notice to the agent process on the following channel:
```
  ma_AGENT_PUBLIC_KEY
```
where AGENT_KEY_PUBLIC key indicates the agent address for the process responsible for
traffic for the applicable user.  Usually the agent process will need to communicate something 
to an external peer process and then issue a message back to the database 
indicating it is appropriate now to transition to the requested state (the new status value).

Similarly, an agent process may receive a message from a peer agent at any time.
These messages also request a change in state of the targeted object.
A corresponding state change command can be issued directly to the database but it is contingent
upon the existing state.
In this way, commands will only be considered valid if the object is still in the intended state
(context) at the instant they are interpreted.

### State Codes
Moving to protocol >= 1.0 we will experiment with migrating to a format for object state
encoded as follows:
```
  type.status.request
```
where "status" indicates the current status of the object record.
The state may start with a "type" which is simply there to differentiate states that may
be distinct, but share a common status.
For example a chit might be pending in several different states, but we need to know the
difference between a chit from our user and a chit to our user.

The optional "request" part similarly indicates the value of the request field in the object.
Having a request component indicates this is a state that needs attention from the agent process.

States requiring action from the user should have a null request in the object, and there is
no direct indication from the state code.
However, the DB view should provide a boolean "action" field indicating the record is in one of those states.

### Message Format
Messages from one agent to another peer agent are sent over [noise protocol](learn-noise.md#noise-protocol-implementation)

Messages are currently encoded as JSON structures.  Future implementations might move to a 
more compressed binary form (or at least a form where properties are much more abbreviated.)
But the current form is quite human-readable and so may be used for some time--particularly in 
testing/validation phases.

Messages destined for another user's agent will typically have the following basic properties:
- **target**: What kind of object (subsystem) the message applies to.  For example, tally, chit, route, lift.
- **action**: A code representing what step or function is being requested or communicated via the packet.
  This may well be the name of state that is being suggested as the next step in a negotiation.
- **object**: The contents of the object (tally, chit, route, lift) itself.
- **try**: An integer starting at 1 indicating how many times the sender has tried to send this message.
- **last**: A timestamp for when the message was generated.
- **to**: The [CHIP Address](learn-users.md#portals) of the recipient, containing some or all of the following, as applicable:
  - **cid**: The [CHIP ID](learn-users.md#chip-addresses) of the sender.
  - **agent**: Encoded agent public key
  - **host**: Hostname or IP number
  - **port**: Port to connect on
- **from**: The [CHIP Address](learn-users.md#portals) of the sender, containing some or all of the following, as applicable:
  - **cid**: The [CHIP ID](learn-users.md#chip-addresses) of the sender.
  - **agent**: Encoded agent public key
  - **host**: Hostname or IP number
  - **port**: Port to connect on

Once an agent receives a message, it may trim the message to only those properties that are required before
forwarding the message on to the database.  Some fields not ever required by the database include:
target, action, from, last, try.

Some messages from the agent to the database are intended to insert or update the content of the object
(tally, chit, route, lift) itself.  These messages must include the object property in its full
JSON exchange format.  In simpler cases, a message may only need to change the status of the object
(for example, voiding or closing) so the whole object may not be necessary.  However, at a minimum
the object will have to contain any identifiers (uuid, for example) needed to uniquely locate the
object in the database.

### Tally Messages
Property: **target**: tally

The *object* property for the tally is defined as follows:
  - **version**: Version (1) of the tally format.
  - **foil**: The [CHIP ID](learn-users.md#chip-addresses) of the customer/employer/client.
  - **stock**: the CHIP ID of the provider/employee/vendor.
  - **uuid**: A [Universally Unique Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) for this particular tally.
  - **comment**: Any comments to the tally the parties have agreed to include.
  - **created**: Date/time the tally was created
  - **contract**: The general terms and conditions of the credit agreement.
    - **name**: Issuer/author of the tally contract language
    - **version**: Version of the contract
  - **terms**: An object containing [credit variables](learn-tally.md#credit-terms)

    - **stock**: The digital signature of the hash by the stock holder (vendor)

Tally state transition messages are as follows:
- *DB->Agent, Agent->Agent;* **Initiate Tally Connection**;
  The process is responding to a tally invitation by
  requesting that a connection be opened to the site containing the tally and asking
  that the actual tally draft be sent back.
  - **action**: ticket;
  - **ticket**: a connection ticket (i.e. not a tally yet!) containing:
    - token: connection code
    - cert: CHIP certificate of the subject peer who will receive the tally

- *DB->Agent:* **Request Agent to Send a Tally**: ***action***: pend  
  The DB requests the agent to send the contained tally proposal to the requester or intended partner.

- *Agent->Agent:* **Sending a Tally Offer**: ***action***: offer  
  A peer agent is sending the contained tally intending to execute on the proposed terms.

- *DB->Agent:* **Request Agent to Refuse Tally**: ***action***: void  
  The DB requests the agent to tell the prospective partner of the tally "no thanks."

- *Agent->Agent:* **Refusing a Tally Offer**: ***action***: void  
  A peer agent is indicating that the referenced tally has been refused by its user.

- *DB->Agent:* **Request Agent to Accept Tally**: ***action***: open  
  The DB requests the agent to tell the prospective partner of the contained, signed tally "I accept."

- *Agent->Agent:* **Accepting a Draft Tally Offer**: ***action***: open  
  A peer agent is transmitting a tally that has been accepted and signed by its user.

- *DB->Agent:* **Request Agent to Notify of Tally Close Request**: ***action***: close  
  The DB requests the agent to tell the partner of the current tally that it has been marked by our user to be closed upon attaining a zero balance.

- *Agent->Agent:* **Marking a Tally for Closing**: ***action***: close  
  A peer agent is indicating that the referenced tally has been marked for closure by its user.

### Chit Messages
Property: **target**: chit

The *object* property for the chit is defined as follows:
  - **uuid**: A [Universally Unique Identifier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier)(UUID) for this particular chit.
  - **tally**: the UUID of the tally this chit belongs to.
  - **date**: Date/time the chit was created
  - **type: The value 'tran' (transaction) or 'lift' (linear or circular)
  - **for**: A description of what the payment is for
  - *units: The number of milli-CHIPs on this chit.
            Positive means a payment from Client to Vendor (or a drop).
            Negative means a payment from Vendor to Client (or a lift).
  - **digest**: A string hash of the rest of the chit in a standard serialized format
  - **digest**: A string hash of the rest of the chit in a standard serialized format
  - **signed**: The digital signature of the hash by the grantor, whether Client or Vendor

### Route Messages
Property: **target**: route

When a route query is being propagated upstream, the *object* property in the message is defined as follows:  
  - **step**: Tracks how many hops away from the original inquiry this query has come (0 on first query).
  - **find**: A CHIP address for the destination entity of this route.  Must minimally contain a cid and agent.  Host and port components may provide hints to intelligent algorithms about where to best find successful routes.
  - **tally**: The UUID of the tally this route query is being sent over (and expected to be returned on.
  
When a route response is being propagated downstream, the *object* property is as follows:
