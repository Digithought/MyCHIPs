Lift Logic

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Lift Maker:

Each server should, on a regular interrupt schedule, act on behalf of each of
its users to do the following:

- Query foils that are below target levels
  - A negative number is credit that needs to be paid at least back to zero.
  - Some foil tallies will have higher targets to accumulate a debit balance
    so it can be spent later.
- Identify the target foil to lift (we will call this vendor peer V)
- Compare the amount desired to lift for the target foil to available 
  accumulations on active stocks.
- Pick a stock to target for the lift.
- Query the upstream peer for that stock (customer peer C) to see if he knows 
  how to reach V upstream somewhere.
- If our query goes unanswered, or answered negatively, try to select another
  eligible stock and repeat the query with that upstream peer.
- If/when we get an affirmative answer back from an upstream peer, proceed 
  to initiate a lift.

- The original search query has a UUID that may have been cached upstream.
- Promote the status to "request", insert the actual amount, and repeat the 
  query.
- This request should propagate all the way around the circle and come back to
  us via peer V.
