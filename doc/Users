In addition to the normal server accepting peer connections, there is also a
private server for the sole purpose of communicating with the user.

This server should be on a port known only to the user's app.  And it is even
better if it is on an IP number different from the peer server.  For example
another machine somewhere could maintain an SSL tunnel to the machine running
the peer server.  That way, potentially hostile outside users might discover 
the user port exists, but their chances of knowing it is a MyCHIPs server, or 
what ID's it answers to are greatly reduced.

The user server is responsible for bootstrapping a user.  When the user server 
is launched, it should know what ID's it is authorized to answer for.  The 
mobile app should connect on this port and send an initial command containing
the following:

- The user's MyCHIPs ID
- ?
- ?
