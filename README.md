# MyCHIPs
A cellular network for implementing open source money based on private credit.

This is _not_ a Bitcoin/blockchain derivative, but rather addresses several 
problems inherent with those technologies.

Briefly, if block-chain based coins can be thought of as a crypto-stock, 
MyCHIPs can be characterized as a crypto-bond.
