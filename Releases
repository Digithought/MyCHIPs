	- Can negotiate/establish tallies with other users
	- Can exchange chits on tallies
	- Basic admin GUI working, add/remove users
	- Can adjust parameter settings
	- Viewer module for visualizing user network
	- Basic user agent model

Pre	2018-Jun
	- Basic user schema
	- Develop front-end view tools in Wylib
	- Develop logic for negotiating tallies, chits

Pre	2017-May
	- Moving implementation to node.js
	- Develop basic contract structure

Pre	2017-Apr
	- Mobile app and user server prototyped in Ruby.
	- mc_admin issues tickets.
	- mc_mobi connects to mc_user, validates the ticket, exchanges keys.

Pre	2017-Mar
	- Initial framework prototyped in Ruby.
	- Includes peer server for communicating with other servers.
	- User server will answer requests from a user agent, such as a cell
	  phone application.  But for now, it is just a command line interface.

Pre	2017-Jan
	- Blank project.
	- The hope is to attract some other team members by posting the project 
	  objectives.
