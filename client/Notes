Setting up React Native on Mac: (chark implementation)
- See: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup

brew install watchman		#File change watcher

Do I need these:	Or is the built-in Java JDK sufficient?
  brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
  brew install --cask zulu11

Installed Android Studio and SDK 12 as per notes above

cd mychips/clients
npx react-native init chark; cd chark

Run from native MacOS terminal (not iterm):
  npx react-native run-android
    Command failed: couldn't find realpath command
    Did: brew install coreutils

To see if my phone on USB is found/recognized:
  ~/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools/adb devices

Setting up React Navigation: https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started
 (Follow procedures for both Android and IOS)
  npm install --save @react-navigation/native
  npm install --save react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
  npx pod-install ios
