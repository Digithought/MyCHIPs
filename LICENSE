The Author of the MyCHIPs software (The Software) grants a license to use
The Software according to the following two options:

Free Option:
You may use this software according to the GNU General Public License Version 
3, a copy of which is included in this distribution, subject to the following 
two conditions, which constitute binding amendments to the license:

  Condition 1: End users of The Software (i.e. individuals and companies
    who engage the trading or exchange of credits) incorporate the terms 
    and conditions specified in contracts/Free.json in their full force and 
    effect, in any chits, tallies or trades they engage in.  This obligation
    is limited to use of the version of Free.json which accompanies the
    version of the software being used by the end user in question.
    
  Condition 2: Service providers who host services (i.e hosts and operators of 
    computers running The Software) on behalf of themselves or other end users,
    A) reasonably cooperate to inform all end users of their obligations under 
       this license, most notably Condition 1 above; and
    B) reasonably cooperate with the Author to collect any royalties due from 
       end users who choose not to abide by Condition 1.

Paid Option:
Service providers and end users who do not abide by the Conditions above may
use this software by instead paying a royalty consisting of:
  A) 1% of all gross revenues associated directly or indirectly with the use 
     of The Software, remitted voluntarily and monthly to, and without explicit 
     invoice or demand by, the Author.
  B) An additional 9% of all such revenues, plus associated collection costs,
     including attorneys fees, in such case that the 1% royalty payments noted
     above  are not made timely or otherwise require collection efforts by 
     Author or its agents.
