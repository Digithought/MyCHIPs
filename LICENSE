[MyCHIPs License Agreement
Version 2, Nov 28, 2019

(For a common language interpretation, please see the file: FREE-USE)

The Author of the MyCHIPs package contained herein offers a dual license to 
the programs, code, files, algorithms, API's, documentation and other content 
in this package, hereinafter "The Software," such that The Software may be 
used according to one of the following two options:

Free Option:
You may use The Software according to the GNU Affero General Public License 
Version 3, a copy of which is included in this distribution (AGPL-3.0), subject 
to the following two conditions, which constitute binding amendments to the 
License:

  Condition 1: End users (including individuals, companies and other 
    organizations) of The Software incorporate the terms and conditions 
    referenced in contracts/Free.yaml, in their full force and effect, in 
    all contracts and transactions (chits, tallies, lifts, payments, trades, 
    etc.) they may engage in.  This obligation pertains to the version of 
    Free.yaml published with the version of the software being used to host 
    the user's account at such time as the contracts in question are agreed to
    by that user.
    
  Condition 2: Service providers who host services (i.e hosts and operators of 
    computers running The Software) on behalf of themselves or other end users,
    A) take prudent and effective measures to inform the end users of their 
       obligations under this license, most notably Condition 1 above; and
    B) proactively collect, and pay monthly to the Author, any royalties due, 
       as explained below, from those who do not abide by Condition 1.
    C) deal honestly with, and representing the best interests of, the users
       they host services for.

Paid Option:
Service providers and end users using the software who do not abide by the 
Conditions above automatically become subject to the paid option consisting of:

  A) 1% of all gross revenues associated directly or indirectly with the use 
     of The Software, remitted voluntarily and monthly to, and without explicit 
     invoice or demand by, the Author; and
  B) An additional 9% of all such revenues, plus all associated collection 
     costs, including attorneys fees, in such case that the 1% royalty payments 
     noted above are not made timely or otherwise require collection efforts by 
     the Author or its agents; and
  C) The greater of $5000 or 300% of any loss incurred by any user, plus 
     collection costs and attorneys fees, as a result of any intentional act by 
     a service provider to cheat or defraud one of their users.  The Author 
     hereby authorizes any user so victimized to collect on its behalf in 
     exchange for voluntarily remitting 10% of any such recovered fees.

For purposes of this License, the term "revenue" shall mean any accrual, pledge,
or receipt of value, whether measured in CHIPs or some other unit, which is
recorded or transferred using the software.
