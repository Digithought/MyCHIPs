This folder is for the support of languages other than English

To generate a new language file:
- Determine the 3-letter ISO code (xyz, for example) for the new language
- Edit test/mocha/language.js to include the code in the languages array (line 14)
- Make sure the last two tests are actually enabled in language.js (line 103)
- Do: cd test/mocha; npx mocha languages (the final test should show failures)
- This should create CSV files in the mocha dir for any tags missing in the target language
- Open the newly created CSV file in a spreadsheet
- Perform the translation, filling in title and help columns for all applicable tags
- Make sure the file is saved back in CSV format
- Be in the mychips/schema folder (the following utilities consult Wyseman.conf)
- Import new lanaguage tags into the db:
    wm-csv2db <the_file_name>.csv
- Check in wm.table_lang (and/or UI applications) for the correct language data
- Create wyseman language file:
    wm-db2wmt -s mychips -l <xyz> >language/<xyz>.wmt
- Submit P/R to mychips/wyselib to include your language translation files/updates

The "-s schema" switch to wm-db2wmt will limit the output to those tables/views belonging
to the specified schema.  If you are translating tables/views that are part of wyselib,
make sure to include those in the wyselib/schema/language folder rather than as part of
the mychips repo.
