Objectives for user agent:

Scripts:
- External script can create N users
- External script to launch user agent for each user in the database

Agent module:
- Can run in conjunction with standard prototype server as a class instance
- Agent model receives notifications from database just as a client app would
- Agent makes decisions on its own in a randomized fashion:

- Agent decisions:
  Tallies:
  - Decide to open new stock relationships
    This represents a job or income stream, so we should find at least one
    We will query to find entities that don't have too many vendors and try with them
  - Respond to new foil invitations (suppliers, employees)
    Establish a random max limit for this (how big a consumer am I?)
  - Request to close an occasional stock tally (quit job)
  - Request to close an occasional foil tally (fire employee or supplier)
  - Randomize cr_limit, dr_limit on tallies
    
  Chits:
  - Randomize a fixed amount to request on each stock tally each cycle
  - Enter requests for these payments
  - Respond to pay requests, randomize answers, but usually yes
  - Respect cr_limit, dr_limit

  Lifts:
  - List stock chits available to trade
  - Request foil chits needed in trade
