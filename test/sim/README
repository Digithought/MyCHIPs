Scripts for establishing a simulated MyCHIPs network

simulation:
  Runs a specified number of instances of the server on the local machine.  This
  is good for simple simulations like testing the state transitions for peer
  dialogs.

watchlogs:
  Launches a terminal window to monitor each of the servers created from the 
  simulation command.
