Local Simulation:					(Try 1)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This was the first attempt at network simulation.
It is pretty crude but probably worth keeping around for now.

simlocal:
  Runs a specified number of instances of the server on the local machine.
  This is good for simple simulations like testing the state transitions for 
  peer dialogs.

watchlogs: (calls watchalog)
  Launches a terminal window to monitor each of the servers created from the 
  simlocal command.
